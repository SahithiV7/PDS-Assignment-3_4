To access real-time weather data, I used the OpenWeather API along with Python's `requests` and `json` libraries. This API offers weather information in JSON format, including details such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed based on location. By making a GET request, I obtained the data and converted it into a Python dictionary to extract key weather metrics. To enhance the presentation of this information, I employed visualization tools like `matplotlib` or `Plotly` to generate a user-friendly dashboard that highlights weather patterns and forecasts. This project illustrates the ease and flexibility of utilizing Python for tasks related to consuming APIs and visualizing data.
