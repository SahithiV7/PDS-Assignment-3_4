Firstly, in the dataset given there are no missing values.
Set a seed of 7.

2.a In this question asked to compare the mean and max highest glucose values of population and sample of 25. There is a difference of 13 in mean(sample as high) and 10 in max values(population is high with 10).

The 13-unit difference in mean glucose levels suggests sampling bias or inadequate representation, while the 10-unit difference in maximum glucose values indicates potential underestimation of high glucose levels in the sample compared to the population.


2.b calculated the BMI of the sample and population, sample BMI lies between 40-43 and population BMI 98th percentile lies between 47 to 50. The sample's BMI range of 40-43 indicates relatively lower body mass indices compared to the population, where the 98th percentile BMI range of 47-50 suggests a higher prevalence of obesity or overweight individuals in the population.

2.c In bootstraping method, we got a better results as compared to sample of 25 and comparition tells us that they are almost similar in numbers as the population.
